Instructions

The default is a black screen. You must click six points in order
to draw the curve (the seventh point is calculated to make the two
curves smooth at their intersection). The default drawing mode is
Blending Functions/Matrix. The following keys change your mode:

"1": Blending Functions/Matrix
"2": deCasteljau
"3": glMap1f
"4": glMap2f (points do not need to be clicked for this since they are hardcoded)
"5": Subdivision

To draw the curve based on your mode, press the "d" key. If you are on subdivison mode,
press the "d" key multiple times to step through the recursion.

To clear the screen, press the "c" key
