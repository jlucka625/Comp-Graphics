Comp-Graphics
=============

Code for projects from CAP4730 Computer Graphics at UF

Please note that the code for these projects and the makefiles were created
on a Linux system.

For the Graphics Pipeline project, we were required to take
Nate Robbin's code from his smooth project, and add the code
to use our own Graphics Pipeline (where we implement the 
algorithms ourselves instead of using OpenGL). Robbin's 
smooth code was convenient because it already provided
data structures for us to easily access the model data.

Pressing the 'y' key will switch to my pipeline mode which
uses flat shading. Pressing the 'u' key will switch to my
pipeline mode with Gouraud shading.

You will need to go into smooth.c and find line 1198 
and change the path to the obj file for your model.
The data folder also provides other models for you
to try out.
